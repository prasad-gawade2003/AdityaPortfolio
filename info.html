								<h2>About Aditya Sakpal</h2>
								<p>
                                   My journey began with a fascination for numbers and evolved into a passion for uncovering insights through data. With a B.Com in Accounting & Auditing and currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics from MIT-World Peace University, I’ve cultivated a unique blend of financial expertise and analytical thinking.
                                    </br>
                                    Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I’ve built a strong foundation in tools and technologies that power today’s data-driven decisions. I’m proficient in Python, R, and SQL for programming and database management, and I use Tableau, Power BI, and Advanced Excel to craft powerful visual stories from raw datasets. My knowledge also extends to SPSS and TORA for statistical and operational analysis, and I’m skilled in financial modeling, forecasting, and portfolio optimization.
                                    </br>
                                    During my internship at Report Hub Pvt. Ltd., I applied these skills in real-time—conducting keyword research, optimizing digital outreach, and generating foreign leads. At S.Trivedi & Co., I strengthened my understanding of accounting systems using Tally and collaborated closely with the finance team.
                                    </br>
                                    My summer research project, A Study of Blockchain Technology: Revolutionizing Accounting Practices, allowed me to explore the intersection of technology and finance, showcasing how blockchain enhances transparency, accuracy, and security.
                                    </br>
                                    Beyond the technical realm, I lead content strategy as Editorial Head for both the Business Analytics Forum and the Rotaract Club, combining communication and coordination with creative thinking. As a district level handball player, I bring the same discipline and team spirit to every project I undertake.
